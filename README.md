Introduction
============

TamaGo is a framework that enables compilation and execution of unencumbered Go
applications on bare metal AMD64/ARM/RISC-V processors.

This example Go application illustrates use of the
[tamago](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago) package
execute bare metal Go code on the following platforms:

| SoC                  | Board                                                                                                                                                                                | SoC package                                                               | Board package                                                                        |

Operation
=========

![Example screenshot](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago/wiki/images/ssh.png)

The example application performs a variety of simple test procedures, each in
its separate goroutine, to demonstrate bare metal execution of Go standard and
external libraries:

  * Directory and file write/read from an in-memory filesystem.
  * SD/MMC card detection and read (only on non-emulated runs).
  * Timer operation.
  * Sleep operation.
  * Random bytes collection (gathered from SoC TRNG on non-emulated runs).
  * Test BTC transaction creation and signing.
  * Test post-quantum key encapsulation (KEM).
  * Hardware accelerated encryption, hashing, key derivation (on non-emulated runs).
  * Large memory allocation.

The following network services are started:

  * SSH server on 10.0.0.1:22
  * HTTP server on 10.0.0.1:80
  * HTTPS server on 10.0.0.1:443

On the USB armory Mk II the network interface is exposed over [Ethernet over
USB](https://github.com/usbarmory/usbarmory/wiki/Host-communication) (ECM
protocol, supported on Linux and macOS hosts).

On the USB armory Mk II LAN the network interface is exposed on both USB and
physical Ethernet interfaces.

On the MCIMX6ULL-EVK the second Ethernet port is used.

The web servers expose the following routes:

  * `/`: a welcome message
  * `/tamago-example.log`: log output
  * `/dir`: in-memory filesystem test directory (available after `test` is issued)
  * `/debug/pprof`: Go runtime profiling data through [pprof](https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/pprof/)
  * `/debug/statsviz`: Go runtime profiling data through [statsviz](https://github.com/arl/statsviz)

The SSH server exposes a console with the following commands (i.MX6UL boards):

```
9p                                                               # start 9p remote file server

wormhole        (send <path>|recv <code>)                        # transfer file through magic wormhole
```

On emulated runs (e.g. `make qemu`) the console is exposed directly on the
terminal.

Building the compiler
=====================

Build the [TamaGo compiler](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-go)
(or use the [latest binary release](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-go/releases/latest)):

```
wget https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago-go/archive/refs/tags/latest.zip
unzip latest.zip
cd tamago-go-latest/src && ./all.bash
cd ../bin && export TAMAGO=`pwd`/go
```

Building and executing on ARM targets
=====================================

Build the application executables as follows:

```
make imx TARGET=usbarmory
```

The following targets are available:

| `TARGET`    | Board            | Executing and debugging                                                                                  |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `usbarmory` | USB armory Mk II | [usbarmory](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago/tree/master/board/usbarmory#executing-and-debugging)     |
| `mx6ullevk` | MCIMX6ULL-EVK    | [mx6ullevk](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago/tree/master/board/nxp/mx6ullevk#executing-and-debugging) |

The targets support native (see relevant documentation links in the table above)
as well as emulated execution (e.g. `make qemu`).

Building and executing on RISC-V targets
========================================

Build the application executables as follows:

```
make TARGET=sifive_u
```

Available targets:

| `TARGET`    | Board            | Executing and debugging                                                                                  |
|-------------|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sifive_u`  | QEMU sifive_u    | [sifive_u](https://github.com/usbarmory/tamago/tree/master/board/qemu/sifive_u#executing-and-debugging)  |

The target has only been tested with emulated execution (e.g. `make qemu`)

Emulated hardware with QEMU
===========================

All targets can be executed under emulation as follows:

```
make qemu
```

The emulation run will either provide an interactive console or emulated
Ethernet connectivity, in the latter case tap0 should be configured as follows
(Linux example):

```
ip addr add 10.0.0.2/24 dev tap0
ip link set tap0 up
ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap group <your user group>
```

An emulated target can be debugged with GDB using `make qemu-gdb`, this will
make qemu waiting for a GDB connection that can be launched as follows:

```
# ARM targets
arm-none-eabi-gdb -ex "target remote 127.0.0.1:1234" example

# RISC-V targets
riscv64-elf-gdb -ex "target remote 127.0.0.1:1234" example
```

Breakpoints can be set in the usual way:

```
b ecdsa.Verify
continue
```
